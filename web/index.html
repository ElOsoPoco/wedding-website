                    Einstein once said, “Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.” After multiple near miss encounters in various states, Zack and Tiffany finally met in Tahoe California for a new hire orientation at a Boutique consulting firm. Although living across the country from one another, both ended up being placed on the same mid-west client for 9 months during one of the worst winters in recent history- 2013 Polar Vortex. Perhaps it was the 0 degree weather, but these two soon became inseparable. Before even dating, their coworkers coined the name “Zaffany” to describe their connection. This only became more evident by the surprising revelations of their ‘almost meets’ from Zack’s undergraduate degree in Washington where Tiffany was raised to both securing job offerings for different companies that share the same New York City building.

                <p class="story-text">
                    By the project’s end, Zack and Tiffany had fallen in love and Zack decided he wanted to quit the consulting firm and take his chances in Orange County. The consulting lifestyle grew tiresome for Tiffany and when asked by a recruiter to meet with Director at a Fortune 500 for a new gig, she jumped on the opportunity. As recruiters typically get paid through their placements and can’t afford candidates to apply through different means, she didn’t know the company she would be interviewing with until day of, which happened to be Ingram Micro, the company Zack was working for. Tiffany received the offer and ended up working at a second company with Zack. Although in different departments, their relationship grew stronger with living in the same city, knowing each other’s bosses, sharing stories, and ultimately having similar life experiences. Zack and Tiffany have now moved on to two different tech companies, but they share a deep history of knowing similar places and people, and enjoy traveling.

                If you plan on staying the night, or even the week, there are a lot of affordable hotel and Airbnb options in Temecula. We recommend staying as close to the venue as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those traveling from out of state, we recommend flying into either San Diego or Ontario International Airport. Both are about 1 hour's drive from Villa de Amore.

                We appreciate you coming from far and wide – city friends, we know that traveling the L.I.E feels like crossing the country – to be with us this summer. Your attendance is as good a gift as any. Who really needs a Vitamix, anyhow? (However, in the event you find it necessary, they are available at Williams Sonoma).

                If you feel inclined to add a little shimmer to our otherwise dull china collection, you can browse our `wants’ over here at Bloomingdale’s. To better dress our guest bedroom, possibly in anticipation of your next long weekend in the city, visit West Elm.
