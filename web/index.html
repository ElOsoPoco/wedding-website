                    Einstein once said, “Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.” After multiple near miss encounters in various states, Zack and Tiffany finally met in Tahoe California for a new hire orientation at a Boutique consulting firm. Although living across the country from one another, both ended up being placed on the same mid-west client for 9 months during one of the worst winters in recent history- 2013 Polar Vortex. Perhaps it was the 0 degree weather, but these two soon became inseparable. Before even dating, their coworkers coined the name “Zaffany” to describe their connection. This only became more evident by the surprising revelations of their ‘almost meets’ from Zack’s undergraduate degree in Washington where Tiffany was raised to both securing job offerings for different companies that share the same New York City building.

                <p class="story-text">
                    By the project’s end, Zack and Tiffany had fallen in love and Zack decided he wanted to quit the consulting firm and take his chances in Orange County. The consulting lifestyle grew tiresome for Tiffany and when asked by a recruiter to meet with Director at a Fortune 500 for a new gig, she jumped on the opportunity. As recruiters typically get paid through their placements and can’t afford candidates to apply through different means, she didn’t know the company she would be interviewing with until day of, which happened to be Ingram Micro, the company Zack was working for. Tiffany received the offer and ended up working at a second company with Zack. Although in different departments, their relationship grew stronger with living in the same city, knowing each other’s bosses, sharing stories, and ultimately having similar life experiences. Zack and Tiffany have now moved on to two different tech companies, but they share a deep history of knowing similar places and people, and enjoy traveling.

                We appreciate you coming from far and wide to be with us this Memorial Day Weekend. Your attendance is as good a gift as any. Who really needs a Vitamix, anyhow? (However, in the event you find it necessary, the exact one the bride wants can be found and even purchased and shipped directly to the bride and groom on our Zola Registry).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel inclined to add a little shimmer to our otherwise dull china collection, you can browse our `wants’ below on Zola. Our if you want to add some extra adventure to our Honeymoon, you can also contribute to that.

                        <p>There is a large parking area at Villa De Amore. Overnight parking is allowed with an early next day exit (before 10a), but if you're planning to drink, we would recommend an Uber or Lyft to/ from your hotel. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE!</p>

                        <p>Of course! Just make sure they are included in your guest count on your RSVP complete with names and dietary restrictions. If you're looking for a date night, but are planning for a family weekend thereafter, you can also find a sitter in the area at Care.com.</p>

                        <p>There are several wineries in the Temecula Valley, that offer wine tastings. We recommend Pointe, South Coast Winery, and Wilson Creek. Outside of wineries, you can play craps at Pechanga Casino, relax at a day spa or golfing, or if you're daring enough, Hot Air Balloon rides. Temecula is also only 1 hour drive from the beaches of San Diego, Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm, Balboa park, or San Diego Zoo.</p>
